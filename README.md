## This Java application fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a structured format. It uses HttpClient to make HTTP requests and the Jackson library to parse JSON responses. The user inputs a city name, and the program retrieves weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The API response is parsed using ObjectMapper, and relevant data is extracted and displayed in a user-friendly format. The program includes error handling for invalid city names or failed API requests. To run this application, users need to replace "your_api_key_here" with a valid OpenWeatherMap API key. This project demonstrates how to consume a REST API in Java using modern HTTP and JSON processing techniques.
